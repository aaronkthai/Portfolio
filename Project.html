    <div class="content2">
        <p>Our project was designed to address the common challenges faced by college students dorming together. 
            These challenges include issues such as one person neglecting their share of household responsibilities, unfair division of chores, and strained relationships due to lack of communication among roommates. 
            Our aim was to alleviate these critical problems and foster a more harmonious living environment for students.
            So we created the following problem statement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "content4">
        <p>“How might we develop an intuitive and engaging digital solution for college-age roommates to collaboratively track, assign, and balance house tasks, fostering a sense of shared responsibility, 
            preventing the accumulation of uncompleted chores, and improving communication between each other?” </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content2">
        <p>We then conducted a comprehensive competitive analysis to gain deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors' applications. 
            Through this analysis, we identified common features shared among all the apps, including the ability to create custom chores, view chore statistics, and receive push notifications to remind users of their responsibilities.
            Additionally, we discovered features that were only present in some apps, such as the option to assign point values to chores requiring manual splitting of chores among roommates instead of an automated system to ensure fairness. 
            Furthermore, we identified unique features, such as the capability to track shared purchases like groceries and supplies that aimed at resolving financial disputes effectively.
            With these insights, we determined the essential features our application should encompass while also identifying convenience features present in competitor apps that could be enhanced or integrated into our own.</p>

    <div class="content2">
        <p> Each member of our group conducted two interviews to gain insights into our users' needs. 
            In my first interview, I discovered that roommates who were already friends before living together tend to experience fewer conflicts and resolve disputes more easily. 
            This led us to refine our target audience to college students who are not acquainted with their roommates prior to living together.
            During the second interview, I found that some students struggle to complete assigned chores on the same day due to busy schedules. 
            As a result, they may postpone tasks to the following day as to not be perceived as neglecting their responsibilities.
            This made me realize that the lack of communication could be a bigger cause of roommate tension than household responsibilites.
            With new insights, our group gathered our data and created a persona to encompass common issues we found among our interviews.

    <div class="content2">
        <p> We then finalized on the features we will implement on our app and created storyboards to provide a better understanding of how the user will use the app. After each creating a low-fidelty prototype, we realized although we had a common understanding
            of core features we had drastically different ideas on how the app should carry out those tasks. After analyzing our prototypes and deciding which version we liked for each core feature, we created a final prototype that checked all of our boxes for
            measuring sucess: Users are able to remind their roommates anonymously to do their household chores through the chatbot system removing the need for confrontation,
            Users are able to track money owed or owe and upload pictures of receipts for evidence,
            Chores are split fairly without bias using an automated system, and 
            Custom chores can be created with various user inputs such as frequency, effort required, and how many days a chore can be pushed back to due to not being able to complete it that day.
